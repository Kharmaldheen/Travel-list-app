#What the project is all about.

The travel-list-app call Far Away is an app built to improve my React skills especially state management. it contains functionalities that are implemented majorly by controlled elements and conditional rendering. when the user wants to travel, the user can add items to pack to the app, can mark the item packed after packing it, and even delete the items if the user don't want the items again. The user can also sort the items based on the input, description and packed status. finally, the user can also clear all the items at once with a clear button.

There's also a stats section where the actions of the users are recorded and displayed. actions such as the number of items added, the number of items packed and its value in percentage in relation to the total number of items.

Happy Checking!!!
